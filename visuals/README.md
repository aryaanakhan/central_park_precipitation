**precipitation_min_max_sd:**
In this graphic, the standard deviation (sd), minimum (min), and maximum (max) values displayed as shaded ribbons and dotted lines respectively.

**precipitation_loess:**
The line is fitted using LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing), which is a non-parametric method that fits multiple regressions in localized subsets of the data.  The plot includes points for individual data observations, a smooth curve representing the LOESS fit, and axis labels and limits.

**precipitation_lm_line_without_se:**
The line is fitted using linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the predictor (year) and response (precipitation) variables. The plot includes points for individual data observations and a straight line representing the linear regression fit. The se=FALSE argument is used to remove the confidence interval around the line.

**precipitation_lm_line_without_se_stats:**
The coefficient estimate for the predictor variable is positive (0.028901), indicating a positive relationship between year and annual precipitation. The p-value associated with the coefficient estimate for the predictor variable (year)  is highly significant (p < 2.2e-16). The Adjusted R-squared value is 0.5532, indicating that approximately 55.32% of the variability in annual precipitation can be explained by the linear relationship with the predictor variable. Given these findings, we can conclude that there is strong statistical evidence to support that precipitation rates in Central Park have increased between 1860 to 2022.

**precipitation_group_trends:**
The smoothed average, maximum, and minimum precipitation lines provide insights into the overall trends, while individual data points offer a glimpse into the variability within each grouping.
