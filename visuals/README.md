**precipitation_min_max_sd:**
In this graphic, the standard deviation (sd), minimum (min), and maximum (max) values displayed as shaded ribbons and dotted lines respectively.

**precipitation_loess:**
The line is fitted using LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing), which is a non-parametric method that fits multiple regressions in localized subsets of the data.  The plot includes points for individual data observations, a smooth curve representing the LOESS fit, and axis labels and limits.

**precipitation_lm_line_without_se:**
The line is fitted using linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the predictor (year) and response (precipitation) variables. The plot includes points for individual data observations and a straight line representing the linear regression fit. The se=FALSE argument is used to remove the confidence interval around the line.

**precipitation_group_trends:**
The smoothed average, maximum, and minimum precipitation lines provide insights into the overall trends, while individual data points offer a glimpse into the variability within each grouping.
